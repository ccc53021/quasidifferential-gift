This file is the output of the 13-round differential by algorithm in the paper.
The differential is '0x0000000000000202 -> 0x0000000500000005' with probability p_{avg} = 2^{-62.06} :
        contains 20 difference characteristics : 1 with 2^-64, 9 with 2^-66, 9 with 2^-66, 1 with 2^-70.
After the algorithm procedure, the updated probability p can be calculated as 2^-57.82.
