python file 'distinguisher_extension.py' can get the extension of key-recovery for the given input difference and output difference.
python file 'quasidifferential_search_and_get_key_space.py' implements Algorithm 3 in the paper, takes 20-round differential 2 as a example.

Directory 'output' contains the outputs of the two 21-round differentials (differential 9 and 10) by usind Algorithm 3.
Directory 'res' contains the differentials (2 20-round differentials and 18 21-round differentials) mentioned in this paper.
