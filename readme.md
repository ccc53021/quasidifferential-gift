python file 'distinguisher_extension.py' can get the extension of key-recovery for the given input difference and output difference.
python file 'quasidifferential_search_and_get_key_space.py' implements the functions searching for quasidifferential trails and deriving the weak-key space in the paper. (Installation 'pyboolector' before using the codes.)
Takes 13-round differential as an example for GIFT-64.
Takes 20-round differential 2 as an example for GIFT-128.

Directory 'output' contains the outputs of the differentials after applying Algorithm 1.
Directory 'res' contains the differentials (characteristics) mentioned in this paper.
